            <h2>Terms</h2>
            <p>
              By downloading, installing, or using <span data-app-name>MyTimetrack</span> (the "App") or our website (the
              "Site"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the App or Site.
            </p>

            <h3>1. License</h3>
            <p>
              Subject to these Terms, we grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use
              the App for your own business or personal purposes, on devices you own or control, in accordance with the
              applicable app store terms.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Purchases</h3>
            <p>
              The App is offered as a one-time lifetime purchase (currently <strong data-price-usd>$9.99</strong>, plus
              any taxes as applicable). Payments, receipts, re-downloads, and refunds are handled by the Apple App Store
              and/or Google Play according to their policies.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Your content and responsibility</h3>
            <p>
              You are responsible for the time logs, labels, rates, invoice details, and any other information you enter
              into the App. You are also responsible for how you use exports (such as CSV timesheets) and any decisions
              you make based on them.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Third-party services</h3>
            <p>
              The App may integrate with third-party services you choose to use (for example, email providers for
              sending exports, and optional GreenInvoice integration). Your use of those services is governed by their
              terms and policies. We are not responsible for third-party services.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Prohibited actions</h3>
            <p>
              You agree not to (a) reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive source code from the App, except as
              permitted by law; (b) abuse, disrupt, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Site; or (c) use the
              App or Site in a way that violates applicable laws.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Disclaimer of warranties</h3>
            <p>
              The App and Site are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or
              implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
              non-infringement, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Limitation of liability</h3>
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
              consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising from or related to your use of
              the App or Site.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Changes</h3>
            <p>
              We may update these Terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date above reflects the most recent
              changes. Continued use of the App or Site after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
            </p>

# SVG Assets

Files here are editable SVG banners/headers you can tweak in Figma/Sketch/Illustrator (or even a text editor).

Notes:
- Some SVGs reference screenshots via relative paths like `../screenshots/day.png`.
- For platforms that require PNG/JPG, export from Figma (recommended).

Included:
- `timetrack-mark.svg` (icon)
- `social-card-1200x628.svg` (vector-only)
- `social-card-1200x628-with-day-screenshot.svg` (uses day screenshot)
- `square-1080x1080-with-summary-screenshot.svg`
- `email-header-600x200.svg`
- `marketplace-banner-3000x1000.svg`

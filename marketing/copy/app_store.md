Time tracking for freelancers

## Promotional Text (optional)
Drag-select your day, export client-ready timesheets, and invoice faster.

## Description
{{APP_NAME}} is a time tracker built for freelancers who bill hourly or manage retainers.

Most trackers feel like "work about work." {{APP_NAME}} is different: you log time directly on a day timeline. Drag-select your work blocks, tag the project, and export a clean CSV timesheet whenever you're ready to bill.

Why freelancers use {{APP_NAME}}:
- Day timeline you can finish (drag to log)
- Projects + optional labels (keep billing clean)
- Month summary and date range list
- Export timesheet CSV via email
- No subscription. No account required.
- Private by default (Face ID lock)
- {{GREENINVOICE_LINE}}

Built for real multi-client work, not just one platform.

## What is {{APP_NAME}}?
{{APP_NAME}} is an iOS time tracker for freelancers. Instead of juggling timers, you log time directly on a day timeline: drag-select, pick a project, optionally add a label, then export a client-ready CSV timesheet.

## Who is it for?
Freelancers who:
- bill hourly or on retainers
- juggle multiple clients
- need clean reporting for invoicing

## Key Differentiators
- Day timeline UX (fast logging)
- Exports designed for billing (CSV via email)
- One-time price: {{PRICE}} (lifetime use, no subscription). No account required.
- Private by default (Face ID lock)
- {{GREENINVOICE_LINE}}

# Landing Page Copy (Blocks)

## Hero
Headline:
Drag-select your day. Export timesheets. Invoice faster.

Subheadline:
{{APP_NAME}} is an iPhone-first time tracker built for freelancers juggling real clients. Log work in seconds with a day timeline, then export a clean CSV timesheet whenever you need to bill.

Primary CTA:
Get {{APP_NAME}} (App Store)

Secondary CTA:
See pricing ({{PRICE}} lifetime)

Trust line:
Private by default (Face ID lock). No "surveillance tracker" vibe.

## Problem -> Solution
### Time tracking breaks when it becomes a second job
- Too many timers
- Too much switching
- Too much cleanup before invoicing

### A day view you can finish
- Drag blocks on a day timeline
- Assign a project + optional label
- Get a month summary
- Export a client-ready CSV timesheet

## Features (Short)
- Day timeline (drag to log)
- Projects + labels
- Month summary + date range list
- Timesheet CSV export via email
- Face ID lock
- {{GREENINVOICE_LINE}}

## How It Works
1. Add your projects (rate optional).
2. Drag-select time on your day timeline.
3. Export a CSV timesheet and send it to your client (or your accountant).

## Who It's For
- Hourly freelancers who need clean reporting
- Retainers and multi-client work
- Anyone who wants "fast and private" over "big dashboard"

## FAQ
Q: Is it only for marketplace work?
A: No. It's designed for all your clients, not tied to one platform.

Q: Do I need to track every minute?
A: No. The workflow supports 15-minute slots and quick labeling.

Q: Do you sync to a server?
A: Currently it's local-first; exports happen when you choose to share a report.

## Closing CTA
If you bill for time, you should spend less time tracking it.

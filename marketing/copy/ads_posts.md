## 1) LinkedIn Post (Founder Voice)
Freelancers: if you bill hourly, the worst part isn't the work. It's turning the work into a timesheet you can invoice from.

I built {{APP_NAME}} for iPhone:
- drag-select your day
- tag the project
- export a clean CSV timesheet

It’s {{PRICE}} for lifetime use (no subscription). If you want the link, reply and I’ll send it.

## 2) Twitter/X (Short)
Time tracking that doesn't feel like surveillance.
Drag-select your day on iPhone -> export a client-ready timesheet CSV.
{{APP_NAME}}: {{LANDING_URL}}

## 3) Reddit / Community Post (No Hype)
I built a small iPhone time tracker for freelancers who hate timers. It's a day timeline: drag blocks, assign a project, export a CSV timesheet for billing.

It’s {{PRICE}} for lifetime use (no subscription). If you’re up for trying it and telling me what sucks, I can share the link.

## Sequence A: Hourly Freelancers (Marketplace + Off-platform)

### Email A1 (Day 1)
Subject options:
- A faster way to turn work into a timesheet
- Quick question about your time tracking
- Drag-to-log time tracking on iPhone

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

{{icebreaker}}

If you bill hourly (or do retainers), do you already have a clean way to turn your day into a client-ready timesheet?

I built {{APP_NAME}}: an iPhone time tracker where you drag-select your day, tag the project, then export a CSV timesheet in seconds.

Worth sending the {{APP_STORE_URL}}?

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email A2 (Day 3)
Subject options:
- Timesheet exports without the admin
- Not tied to one marketplace

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

One thing we kept hearing from freelancers: marketplace trackers help only inside that marketplace.

{{APP_NAME}} is meant for the rest of your work too: quick logging, project labels, monthly summary, and CSV exports you can email to any client.

If you want, I can send a 30-second screen recording + the install link.

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email A3 (Day 6)
Subject options:
- Free timesheet template?
- What clients actually accept

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

If helpful, I can send you a client-ready CSV timesheet template (no signup).

{{APP_NAME}} exports in the same structure, so you can go from "worked today" to "ready to invoice" fast.

Want the template or the app link?

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email A4 (Day 9)
Subject options:
- The "2+ clients" problem
- Less tracking, more billing

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

When you're juggling multiple clients, time tracking breaks because it needs too much attention.

The design of {{APP_NAME}} is intentionally low-friction: drag blocks, pick the project, done. Face ID lock so it doesn't feel invasive.

If you're open, it's {{PRICE}} for lifetime use (no subscription). Want the link?

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email A5 (Day 12) - Breakup
Subject options:
- Should I close the loop?
- Last note from me

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

No worries if this isn't relevant. Should I stop reaching out?

If you ever want a faster way to create timesheets from your iPhone day, {{APP_NAME}} is here:
{{APP_STORE_URL}}

{{FROM_NAME}}

## Sequence B: Israel / GreenInvoice (If Relevant)

### Email B1 (Day 1)
Subject options:
- GreenInvoice + time tracking (iPhone)
- Faster timesheets -> faster invoices

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

{{icebreaker}}

Do you track hours somewhere and then rebuild it again to invoice?

{{APP_NAME}} is an iPhone time tracker built for freelancers: drag-select your day, assign a project/label, export timesheet CSV, and {{GREENINVOICE_LINE}}.

Want the install link?

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email B2 (Day 3)
Subject options:
- Less admin between work and invoice
- Quick demo?

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

If you're using GreenInvoice, the goal is simple: reduce the steps between "tracked time" and "sent invoice".

I can send a quick demo clip + link. Interested?

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email B3 (Day 6)
Subject options:
- Your monthly close, but faster
- Timesheets you can actually email

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

{{APP_NAME}} keeps it clean:
- day timeline (drag to log)
- month summary
- export CSV timesheets for any client

It's {{PRICE}} for lifetime use (no subscription). Want the link?

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email B4 (Day 9)
Subject options:
- Not for everyone (quick check)
- Sanity check

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

Quick sanity check: are you billing hourly/retainer right now, or mostly fixed-price?

If it's fixed-price, totally get it if time tracking isn't a priority.

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email B5 (Day 12) - Breakup
Subject options:
- Close the loop?
- Should I stop?

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

Should I stop reaching out?

If you ever want a faster iPhone workflow for timesheets/invoicing, here's {{APP_NAME}}:
{{APP_STORE_URL}}

{{FROM_NAME}}

## Sequence C: Agency / Multi-Project Freelancers

### Email C1 (Day 1)
Subject options:
- Multi-client time tracking on iPhone
- A day view built for agencies

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

{{icebreaker}}

If you're juggling multiple client projects, what's your current workflow for keeping time logs clean enough to bill?

{{APP_NAME}} is a drag-to-log day timeline on iPhone with projects + labels, a month summary, and quick CSV export.

Want the link?

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email C2 (Day 3)
Subject options:
- Project labels (so billing is easy)
- Your month summary, in seconds

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

The feature agency folks seem to like most is labels: you can track "client A / strategy" vs "client A / revisions" without overhead.

If you share how you bill (hourly vs retainer), I can point you to the best setup.

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email C3 (Day 6)
Subject options:
- One export per client
- Cleaner invoices

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

Exporting is intentionally boring: you get a CSV you can email, attach to invoices, or drop into your bookkeeping.

If you're open, it's {{PRICE}} for lifetime use (no subscription). Want the link?

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email C4 (Day 9)
Subject options:
- Quick no-pressure question
- Is this even a problem for you?

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

Is time tracking currently painful for you, or already solved?

If it's solved, I'll stop bugging you.

{{FROM_NAME}}

### Email C5 (Day 12) - Breakup
Subject options:
- Close the loop
- Last note

Body:
Hi {{first_name}} -

Last note from me. If you want an iPhone-first workflow for multi-client timesheets, here's {{APP_NAME}}:
{{APP_STORE_URL}}

# Marketplace Messaging Scripts (Keep It Compliant)

Use these only where allowed. Many platforms forbid solicitation or off-platform contact sharing before a contract. When in doubt, keep it high-level and link to a public page only if permitted.

## Message 1: "Quick Question" (On-platform)
Hi {{first_name}} -

Quick question: when you're doing hourly/retainer work (especially across multiple clients), what do you use to turn your workday into a clean timesheet for billing?

I'm building an iPhone-first tracker that makes this faster (drag-select timeline, export CSV). If you're open, I'd love to ask 2 questions and send you beta access.

## Message 2: Follow-up (2-3 days later)
Hey {{first_name}} -

Just following up. If time tracking is already solved for you, no worries.

If it's still a pain, I'm happy to share a short demo and get your feedback.

## Message 3: Feedback Ask (low-pressure)
Hi {{first_name}} -

I'm collecting feedback from working freelancers: what do clients actually require from a timesheet (format, granularity, notes)?

If you reply with a sentence or two, I'll send you the template we use + beta access.

## Profile/Tagline Snippet (If You Have a Landing Page)
{{APP_NAME}}: drag-to-log time tracking on iPhone. Export client-ready timesheet CSVs. Private by default (Face ID).

# Reply Templates (After They Respond)

Keep replies short, human, and specific. Don't over-explain.

## If Interested
Subject: Re: {{APP_NAME}}

Thanks {{first_name}}.

Here’s the link: {{APP_STORE_URL}}

Two quick questions so I can point you to the best setup:
1) Do you bill mostly hourly, retainer, or fixed-price?
2) Do clients require detailed notes per time block, or just totals?

If you want, reply with one client example and I’ll tell you the cleanest way to label it in {{APP_NAME}}.

## If They Ask "How is this different from Upwork tracker?"
Great question.

Upwork’s tracker helps inside Upwork. {{APP_NAME}} is meant for the rest of your work too: a fast iPhone day timeline + exports you can send to any client.

If your work is 100% inside a marketplace tracker already, it might not be worth switching.

## If They Ask About Privacy
{{APP_NAME}} is designed to feel private:
- Face ID lock
- you choose when to export/share reports
- no "always-on" tracking concept

If you want, tell me what you’re worried about (clients, teammates, etc.) and I’ll answer directly.

## If Not Now
All good.

Would it be OK if I follow up in 6-8 weeks? If not, just say "no" and I’ll close the loop.

## If Unsubscribe
Understood. You’re removed and I won’t email again.

Sorry for the interruption.

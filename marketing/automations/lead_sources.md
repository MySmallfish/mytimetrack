# Lead Sources + How To Pull 200 Qualified Leads (Without Getting Banned)

Goal: build a small, high-quality list (200) where each lead is likely to need time tracking + exports.

## Source Types (Ordered by Safety)
1. Freelancer portfolio websites (best)
2. LinkedIn profiles that link to a public portfolio
3. Marketplace public profile pages (discovery only)

## What To Capture Per Lead
- Name + role
- Portfolio URL
- A grounding detail for `icebreaker` (a service line, niche, or client type)
- A public contact route (email on site, or contact form)

## Marketplace Discovery Playbook (Use As Discovery, Not As Email Harvest)
- Search by role + "hourly" language.
- Prioritize profiles that mention:
  - reporting, timesheets, invoicing
  - retainers, long-term clients
  - agency / multiple projects
- Click through to their portfolio link (many freelancers include it).
- Use the portfolio site as the contact source, if public.

## LinkedIn Discovery (Often Cleaner)
- Search for:
  - "freelance" + your target role
  - "hourly" / "retainer" / "consultant"
- Filter for people who link a personal site.
- Use that site for contact details and grounding facts.

## Quality Bar
Only email if you can honestly answer:
- Why is this person likely to bill for time?
- Do I have a legitimate, non-creepy reason to contact them?
- Can I write a 1-sentence icebreaker based on something real?

# Compliance + Deliverability Guardrails

This kit is designed to avoid obvious pitfalls, but you still own the risk. If you're unsure, get legal advice for your jurisdiction.

## Marketplace Guardrails
- Don't scrape gated profile data or bypass login walls.
- Prefer:
  - On-platform messages (when ToS require it).
  - Public contact routes the freelancer chose to publish (their website contact page, public email on portfolio).
- Don't mention "I found you on Upwork" unless that info is public and mentioning it doesn't violate ToS. When in doubt: don't mention the platform; mention their portfolio site instead.

## Cold Email Guardrails (Minimum Bar)
- Only contact leads where you have a lawful basis to process personal data.
- Keep messages short, honest, and non-deceptive.
- Use a real sender identity and a monitored reply-to inbox.
- Include:
  - A clear opt-out mechanism.
  - Your business postal address (CAN-SPAM).
- Honor opt-outs within 10 business days (US), and immediately in practice.

## Deliverability Basics
- Warm up a domain/inbox; do not start from a brand-new domain blasting 1,000/day.
- Throttle:
  - Week 1: 20-50/day
  - Week 2: 50-150/day (only if bounces/complaints are low)
- Use a suppression list (unsubscribed, bounced, do-not-contact).
- Avoid spammy patterns: heavy images, lots of links, "FREE!!!", all-caps subjects.

## Personalization Rules (Avoid Hallucinations)
- Only personalize with facts you actually have in your lead record.
- If you can't verify anything, use a generic opener (no fake compliments).

## Tracking Without Being Creepy
- Prefer UTM parameters on your landing page link.
- Avoid pixel tracking if you expect a trust-sensitive audience.

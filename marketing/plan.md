# Focused GTM Plan: Freelancers From Marketplaces

## Objective
Convert high-intent, hourly-billing freelancers into paid users of {{APP_NAME}} using focused, personalized outbound + lightweight on-platform messaging, while staying within platform rules and anti-spam laws.

## ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
- Works hourly or on retainers (needs time accountability).
- Juggles 2+ clients/month (needs fast logging).
- Sends monthly invoices or timesheets (needs export).
- Mobile-first (logs time from phone, not a desktop tracker).

### High-Value Sub-Segments
1. "Marketplace + Off-platform":
   - Uses Upwork/Fiverr for lead gen but also has private clients.
   - Pain: Upwork tracker doesn't help for non-Upwork work.
2. "Invoice-heavy":
   - Mentions invoicing, bookkeeping, or strict reporting.
3. Israel-based freelancers:
   - Likely to recognize GreenInvoice value immediately (if relevant).

## Positioning
**"The fastest way to turn a day into a timesheet."**
- Drag-select your timeline to log work.
- Assign a project and label.
- Export CSV timesheets.
- (Optional) Create invoices faster (GreenInvoice).
- Face ID lock: private by default.

## Core Offer
Keep it simple and consistent:
- Price: {{PRICE}} (lifetime use, no subscription)
- {{NO_ACCOUNT_LINE}}
- Optional: early adopter promo codes (if you have them), but don't overcomplicate the message.

## Funnel (Outbound -> Paid)
1. Lead source:
   - Marketplace directories (public) + freelancer portfolio sites.
   - LinkedIn/Twitter profiles that link to marketplace profiles.
2. Qualify:
   - Hourly/retainer signals, multiple clients, invoicing language.
3. Personalize:
   - 1 real sentence: {{icebreaker}}
4. CTA:
   - "Want me to send the App Store link?" or "Want beta access?"
5. Convert:
   - Landing page -> install -> 2-minute setup -> first timesheet export.
6. Retain:
   - Email nudge: "export your first CSV", "add 2nd project", "monthly summary".

## What We Say (Message Pillars)
- Speed: "drag-select, done."
- Trust: Face ID lock, local-first feel, no surveillance vibe.
- Professional output: timesheets and invoices without fiddling.
- Multi-client reality: not tied to a single marketplace.

## 30-Day Execution Plan
### Week 1: Baseline + Proof
- Create a 200-lead list across 2 segments (100 each).
- Send Sequence A to segment 1 and Sequence B/C to segment 2 (A/B test subject lines only).
- Goal metrics:
  - Bounce < 2%
  - Open 40%+ (if using open tracking)
  - Reply 5%+
  - Positive reply 1%+

### Week 2: Iterate
- Keep the winner segment + rewrite the first email only.
- Add a lightweight lead magnet:
  - "Client-ready timesheet CSV template" (included in `marketing/assets/templates/`).
- Add a 2-line PS to Email 1: "If you're not tracking hours, ignore this."

### Week 3: Double Down
- Scale sends (only if complaint/unsub rate is low).
- Add a referral loop:
  - "Invite 2 freelancer friends -> get 1 month free" (or similar).
- Collect 3 testimonials (even short one-liners) from early users.

### Week 4: Lock In Distribution
- Repeatable inbound:
  - Post 2/week in freelancer communities (copy included).
  - Ship 2 short demo clips (screen recording) as social proof.
- Launch 1 partnership:
  - bookkeeping/invoicing consultants, small agencies, or a freelancer newsletter.

## Lead Targets (Where To Look)
Use marketplaces as a discovery surface, then prefer public portfolio contact routes.
- Profiles that say:
  - "hourly", "retainer", "monthly", "timesheet", "invoice", "reporting"
  - "remote", "consultant", "agency", "multiple clients"
- Roles that commonly need reporting:
  - dev, design, marketing, PM, VA, consulting, translation

## Conversion Optimizers
- Landing page should show:
  - 1 hero screenshot (day view)
  - 3 bullets (speed, exports, privacy)
  - CTA: "Get the app" (App Store) or "Join beta" (email)
- First-run UX goal:
  - Add 1 project
  - Log 30 minutes
  - Export CSV

## What Not To Do
- Don't blast. Quality > volume (freelancers hate spam).
- Don't pretend you "love their work" if you didn't review it.
- Don't rely on marketplace outreach if it risks account bans; use it as discovery, not a growth hack.
